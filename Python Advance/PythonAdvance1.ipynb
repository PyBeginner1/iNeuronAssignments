    "\n",
    "Ans. Python's OOP provides a structure to the program.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides concepts such as: Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.\n",
    "- Object Oriented Programming makes program easy to understand and efficient.<br>\n",
    "- Since the class is sharable, the code can be re-used.<br>\n",
    "- We can divide a program into several smaller segments thus making it understandable and structured.<br>\n",
    "- Polymorphism provides same interface for different objects.<br>"
