    "Ans. **Encapsulation** describes the idea of wrapping the data and methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restriction on accessing the varaible and methods directly and can prevent accidental modification of data."

    "\n",
    "Ans. The result is equivalent. The __add__() method in Python specifies what happens when you call + on two objects. __radd__ is only called if the left object does not have an __add__ method, or that method does not know how to add the two objects (which it flags by returning NotImplemented). Both classes have an __add__ method, which do not return NotImplemented. Therefore the __radd__ method would never be called."

    "\n",
    "Ans. Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string."
