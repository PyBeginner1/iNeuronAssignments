    "\n",
    "Ans. If you have `__getattribute__` method in your class, python invokes this method for every attribute regardless whether it exists or not. Python will call `__getattr__` method whenever you request an attribute that hasn't been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your class contains both these method then `__getattribute__` is called first. If `__getattribute__` returns an AttributeError then `__getattr__` will be invoked. "
