    "Ans. Circular imports are the result of bad designs and can be resolved with better code design. A simple solution is that sometimes both modules can just be merged into a single, larger module."

    "Ans. Python **_ _all__** is a variable that can be set in the **_ _init__.py** file of a package. Python **_ _all__** is a list of public objects of that module. The **_ _all__** tells the semantically “public” names from the module"

    "\n",
    "Ans. We use the if-statement to run blocks of code only if our program is the main program executed. This allows our program to be executable by itself, but friendly to other Python modules who may want to import some functionality without having to run the code."

    "An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation. While 3 − 4 × 5 can also be written 3 − (4 × 5), that means something quite different from (3 − 4) × 5"
